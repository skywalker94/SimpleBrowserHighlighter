# üñçÔ∏è Simple Highlighter (Chrome Extension)

A privacy-friendly Chrome extension that lets you **highlight text**, **persist highlights across page reloads**, and **quickly highlight via keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+H`)**.

It remembers your **last-used color**, supports and stores **recently used colors**, and includes a **VIBGYOR-y color palette** for quick access ‚Äî all while being **secure and sandboxed** (no external scripts, no data collection).

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. Smart highlighting
- Select any text on a web page.
- Use the popup (toolbar icon) or **Ctrl+Shift+H** to instantly highlight it with your last-used color.
- The highlighter now supports **smart toggling**:
  - If your selection is *not highlighted*, it gets highlighted.
  - If your selection is *partially highlighted*, it merges and expands the highlight.
  - If your selection is *fully highlighted*, pressing the shortcut again removes the highlight.
- Highlights are safely inserted as `<span>` elements with inline background color ‚Äî no HTML injection.

### 2. Persistent highlights
- Highlights automatically persist in Chrome‚Äôs local storage.
- When you reload or revisit the same page, your highlights are restored.
- Storage is fully local (never synced or uploaded).

### 3. Color memory and palette
- Your **last used color** is remembered automatically.
- A **recents bar** shows up to 5 colors you actually *used to highlight text* (not just previewed).
- Includes a **VIBGYOR quick palette** (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red) for instant selection.

### 4. Clear all highlights
- Click **‚ÄúClear All‚Äù** in the popup to remove *all* highlights from the current page and clear them from storage.
- A small confirmation toggle prevents accidental mass clearing.

### 5. Keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+H`)
- Default shortcut: **Ctrl+Shift+H**
- Works on Windows, Linux, and ChromeOS.  
  On macOS, you can manually bind **Command+Shift+H**.
- This triggers ‚Äúhighlight or toggle highlight‚Äù without opening the popup.

## üé® Usage

**From the popup:**
1. Select text on any regular webpage (HTTP/HTTPS only).
2. Click the extension icon.
3. Pick a color or one of the VIBGYOR tiles.
4. Click **"Mark"** ‚Äî the selection is highlighted and saved.
5. To remove all highlights, click **"Clear All"** and confirm.

**Using the keyboard shortcut:**
1. Select text.
2. Press **`Ctrl+Shift+H`** (or `Command+Shift+H` on Mac if configured).

## üß† Persistence Details

Highlights are stored per-URL in `chrome.storage.local` as a safe, minimal JSON array (text and color).  
The **content script** restores all highlights automatically when the page is reloaded.

When a highlight is removed (either manually or via toggle), it is immediately deleted from storage ‚Äî keeping your data clean and consistent.

All operations (add, remove, clear all) are handled **safely and asynchronously**, with no direct HTML re-insertion or unsafe DOM operations.

## üõ°Ô∏è User Privacy & Data Guarantees

#### Core Trust Principles
This extension is built on a foundation of maximum transparency and minimal intrusion. I guarantee that the code running in your browser is only what you installed, and it does not compromise your browsing data.

- ‚úÖ **No remote code, analytics, or network requests.** The extension operates entirely offline once installed. It contains no external tracking scripts or analytics beacons, and it does not connect to any third-party servers to send or receive data, ensuring **zero data leakage**.


- ‚úÖ Uses **only `activeTab`, `scripting`, and `storage` permissions.**  In adherence to the principle of least privilege. The extension only asks for the bare minimum permissions required to function: applying highlights to the current tab, and saving your data locally. It has **no permission to read your history, cookies, or activity on other tabs**.


- ‚úÖ **Sanitizes all inputs (color, text).** User-provided inputs, such as custom highlight colors or text, are strictly validated and cleaned before being processed. This critical measure prevents the introduction of malicious data that could be exploited by an attacker.


- ‚úÖ **Refuses to run on non-HTTP(S) pages (like `chrome://` or the Web Store).** For your protection, the extension is intentionally blocked from executing its code on browser-internal pages or protected domains. This sandboxing prevents potential interactions with sensitive system information.


- ‚úÖ **Highlights are added as plain text (no HTML re-insertion) to avoid XSS risks.** When applying a highlight to a webpage, we ensure the process is strictly text-based. This avoids manipulating the page's underlying HTML structure, eliminating the most common vector for **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities.


- ‚úÖ All data (highlights, recents) stays **local in `chrome.storage.local`**. Your saved highlights, recent colors, and settings are stored only on your machine within the secure, private storage area managed by your browser. **No data ever leaves your device**.


<details>
<summary>Why is your <b>Data Stored Locally?</b> (No Cloud Sync)</summary>

> While the extension supports a potential implementation for cross-device synchronization using `chrome.storage.sync`, the feature has been intentionally omitted to ensure data reliability and consistency. The native sync feature is inherently limited by **strict size and item-count quotas**, meaning large highlight sets would inevitably **fail to sync** and fall back to local storage. This mixed outcome‚Äîwhere some user highlights are synced and others remain local‚Äîcreates a confusing and unreliable user experience.

> **An added benefit of this decision is enhanced security and privacy:** your highlight data never leaves your device and is never stored on a third-party server. To prevent the frustration of incomplete or partial data transfer, all highlight data is currently kept exclusively within **local storage**.

## üß∞ Permissions Explained

| Permission | Why It‚Äôs Needed |
|-------------|----------------|
| `scripting` | To inject the safe highlight/clear functions into the active page when you click or use the shortcut. |
| `activeTab` | Temporarily grants access to the active tab‚Äôs content when invoked (no persistent access). |
| `storage` | To store highlights and your color preferences locally. |
| `host_permissions` | Only for `http://*/*` and `https://*/*` so highlights can persist across reloads. |

## ‚å®Ô∏è Shortcut Tips

If `Ctrl+Shift+H` is already taken or blocked:
1. Open `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`
2. Find **‚ÄúSafe Persistent Highlighter‚Äù**
3. Set a custom shortcut for **‚ÄúHighlight current selection with last-used color.‚Äù**
4. You can set different bindings per OS (e.g., `Command+Shift+H` on macOS).

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

- Highlights only work on normal web pages. They **do not work** on Chrome internal pages, PDF viewers, or sites that isolate scripts (like Google Docs).  
- Avoid highlighting very large chunks of text across multiple complex HTML elements ‚Äî browsers handle smaller highlights more reliably.
- To change your default color quickly, just use the popup and select a new one ‚Äî it‚Äôll become your new default.
- You can export/import highlights by reading from `chrome.storage.local` in the DevTools console if needed (advanced use).

## üß± Technical Security & Hardening

* **All highlighting is done using text nodes only (no HTML injection).** This design choice completely bypasses the risks associated with dynamically adding new HTML elements, which is a common source of code execution vulnerabilities.
* **Color values are validated with strict regex (`#RGB` / `#RRGGBB`).** All user-defined color inputs are aggressively scrubbed and matched against strict patterns before use. This prevents attackers from injecting malicious code fragments into style attributes.
* **Each highlight span is tagged with a unique class name (`__simple_ext_highlight_safe`) and optional `data-ext-origin` attribute.** Using a unique, prefixed class ensures the extension's styles and scripts do not interfere with the website's original CSS or functionality (i.e., avoids style collisions).
* **Clearing highlights only removes spans created by the extension.** The cleanup function is narrowly scoped to target only elements bearing the extension's unique class name, guaranteeing that no other content or elements on the page are accidentally deleted or modified.
* **Error messages are shown in the popup UI ‚Äî no `alert()` calls on the page.** All user feedback, especially error reporting, is contained within the secure extension popup. This prevents using disruptive and often-abused native browser functions like `alert()` on the main webpage, maintaining a clean user experience.
